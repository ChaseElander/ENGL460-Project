# Murder Mystery Interactive Fiction

Our group is proposing a Twine application that will argue that entertainment for entertainment's sake has value.

## Overview
We propose to create a murder mystery game based on the choose your own adventure (CYOA) concept. The creation of this game should take approximately 4-5 weeks. We will use Twine to create our game. The purpose of this game is to create an artifact for purely entertainment purposes. We argue that entertainment is important within our society. In an era where everyone and everything wants to make an argument and is trying to persuade you, we want to remind people that we can have artifacts that are not trying to make an argument. There have been many murder mystery games before, especially board games such as Clue. However we want to host the game online because today everything is moving towards the digital. Additionally, we want to incorporate the CYOA aspect into the game so that we can give the players options and make it fun for them. Unlike other CYOA games we will have a complex story in which alternatives endings are possible. This is important because it emphasizes the fact that different actions have different consequences. In this way, it mirrors real life.

## Plan
We are creating an interactive, CYOA, murder mystery game on Twine. We will be using Github as a collaboration platform. Chase has created a repository for our project and added Rachel and Maria as contributors. The repository will host our project proposal and will be used as a basis for project management. Within the repository, we will also keep track of our progress on individual tasks. For easier communication between the team members, we have decided to create a group conversation on Slack. The game itself will be created on Twine. Within Github we will created a folder dedicated to our Twine story. In the folder we will have one document per story box which all of us will collaborate to create. This will be the bulk of content creation. We will then have one person extrapolating the information from the documents and entering it onto the actual Twine website. This will be a piece-by-piece process. When we finish a substantive amount of work, a designated team member will implement the changes on Twine. We have decided this will be the best approach, as opposed to creating the whole story and then waiting until the end to implement it into Twine, because in this manner we will slowly learn how to use Twine and if any errors arise we can fix them on the go. **I really like this plan; I think it's a very smart approach to managing collaboration on Twine. I wonder, though, how you will organize and track the overall structure of the game?** We will gather our images from an open source website. At the moment, we have divided our main tasks into 3 categories. The first task is storyboarding; we will choose the amount of characters, create different murder weapons, choose the number of rooms/locations, establish the clue types, and create the accusation style. Our second task is the game world backstory/experience. We will create backstories for the characters, establish settings and themes, and determine whether we will have a looping game **What does that mean?**. Our third task will only be completed if we have time. These are our stretch goals. We want to create an option where the player is the murderer. We also want to integrate a run away option where the player can just choose to run away instead of investigate the murder; this is meant to be humorous. We were also considering implementing a timer into the game; this would tie in with the storyline of the player being the next murder victim. Along the same lines, we wanted to establish a certain time value at which the player dies.  We have a mockup notecard map planned for November 10th. Therefore, we will have a preliminary completion of the storyboarding tasks. On November 10th, after fleshing  our story on notecards, we will also create an asset chart which will be posted on the Github. Our mockup will be finalized by November 16th. The project will be completed by December 12th.

**Do you anticipate the murderer being randomized? Or is the same person always the murderer? How do you plan to randomize this? Will the story branch based on the murderer or will it always be roughly the same investigation each time?**

**Also, as a note, this was really hard to read because it was a single block of text. Making use of some more bullets and subheadings might have helped work this out.**

## Technologies Utilized
We are utilizing Twine for production and Github for collaboration. We have also created a Slack group conversation to facilitate communication. We have cloned the repository onto the desktop version of Github and will be using text editors of our choice.

### Story Notes
You can be the next victim

* The reason the player is looking for the murderer is because the player is the next victim. So the player has to figure out who the murderer is before the murderer kills the player.

**Are there going to be randomly generated suspects? How many? How does the mechanic of investigation work? What will the setting be?**

## Argument
Challenge of play creates entertainment, too easy/too hard makes less entertainment, & entertainment has value

## Justification Of Technology
Jekyll website could work for this, but pages may be accessible out of order due to nature of hypertext linking
Twitter Bot couldn't really achieve this interactive fiction stylization. Disallows world building and storytelling.
Twine allows branching, nonlinear story in the order we want the players to experience them. Twine is easy to model as a flowchart  and/or with Notecard Map. Storyboarding also works well with the story side of the project.
While Twine may not be the most technically complicated technology available, it will allow us to create an argument by pseudo narrating the world to players.

## Division of Tasks/Work
Chase - Twine Implementation, Github Management

* Chase is in charge of continually integrating the story changes onto Twine. Chase has also created a Github repository and has added Rachel and Maria as contributors. Chase will manage the Github and make sure nothing breaks.

Maria - Story boarding, story creation

* Maria will collaborate with Rachel on story creation and story boarding. She will be in charge of updating the timeline and send reminders and deadlines to the rest of the team.

Rachel - Story boarding/creation, Original Concept

* Rachel came up with the original concept. She will work with Maria on story creation and story boarding.

**The plan looks good.**

**Overall, I think this is a good start to a proposal, but I'm a little worried about the lack of discussion of how the game will work. There are a lot of different possible mechanics for how detection works (physical clues, interviews, etc). How do you plan to model that?**

**Might thinking about some games (say LucasArts-style adventure games or *Carmen Sandiego*, which foreground very different detection methods) might help clarify this.**

**For the mock-up, I want to see a description of the overall story, even if it's just one example of a walk-through, as well as some discussion of what choices the player can make.**
