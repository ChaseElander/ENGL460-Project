# Murder Mystery Interactive Fiction
     Our group is proposing a Twine application that will argue that entertainment for entertainment's sake has value

## Overview
We propose to create a murder mystery game based on the choose your own adventure (CYOA) concept. The creation of this game should take approximately 4-5 weeks. We will use Twine to create our game. The purpose of this game is to create an artifact for purely entertainment purposes. We argue that entertainment is important within our society. In an era where everyone and everything wants to make an argument and is trying to persuade you, we want to remind people that we can have artifacts that are not trying to make an argument. There have been many murder mystery games before, especially board games such as Clue. However we want to host the game online because today everything is moving towards the digital. Additionally, we want to incorporate the CYOA aspect into the game so that we can give the players options and make it fun for them. Unlike other CYOA games we will have a complex story in which alternatives endings are possible. This is important because it emphasizes the fact that different actions have different consequences. In this way, it mirrors real life.

## Technologies Utilized
Utilizing Twine for production, Github for Collaboration.

### Story Notes
You can be the next victim

## Argument
Challenge of play creates entertainment, too easy/too hard makes less entertainment, & entertainment has value

## Justification Of Technology
Jekyll website could work for this, but pages may be accessible out of order due to nature of hypertext linking
Twitter Bot couldn't really achieve this interative fiction stylization. Disallows world building and storytelling.
Twine allows branching, nonlinear story in the order we want the players to experience them. Twine is easy to model as a flowchart  and/or with Notecard Map. Storyboarding also works well with the story side of the project.
While Teine may not be the most technically complicated technology available, it will allow us to create an argument by pseudo narrating the world to players.
