### Story Notes
You can be the next victim

## Argument
Challenge of play creates entertainment, too easy/too hard makes less entertainment, & entertainment has value

## Justification Of Technology
Jekyll website could work for this, but pages may be accessible out of order due to nature of hypertext linking
Twitter Bot couldn't really achieve this interative fiction stylization. Disallows world building and storytelling.
Twine allows branching, nonlinear story in the order we want the players to experience them. Twine is easy to model as a flowchart  and/or with Notecard Map. Storyboarding also works well with the story side of the project.
While Teine may not be the most technically complicated technology available, it will allow us to create an argument by pseudo narrating the world to players.

## Division of Tasks/Work
Chase - Twine Implementation, Github Management

Maria - Story boarding, story creation

Rachel - To be determined by Rachel, Original Concept
