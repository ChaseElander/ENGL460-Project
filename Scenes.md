## Intro to the house

''Welcome to Madhouse Manor''
You have been invited here, to partake of dinner, entertainment, and many festivities that your distinguished host
has provided for you. We hope you have fun and are prepared for everything tonight has to [[offer->activities]].

## activities

Upon entering the house, you and your plus one see 3 rooms to possibly enter first. There is a [[coat room->coat room]] to
the right  where many people are going in and out of, there is a [[small office->small office 1]] where there seems to be a
few people talking in hushed tones with each other. Finally, straight ahead there is the [[main room->main room]] where the
majority of people seem to be congregating. You really want to shed your coat, but you're also curious about what is in the
office. Where do you go?

## Small Office

You enter the office behind the 2 men who are sitting facing the fire place having a quiet conversation. They don't notice you enter the room alone and continue the conversation:

Man 1: I don't know Roger, the guy just seems so unstable. There's no way he will do well in the company. (He jiggles his wrist to fix the position of his expensive looking Rolex watch)

Man2: But his family is too important to the state, if we get rid of him, our stocks could plummet. His family practically controls the market.

Man 1: Yeah, but if we find just cause, then who are they to do anything? They know what kind of man he is, and he certainly isn't worth those stupid Louis Vuitton shoes he wears.

Man 2: Maybe there is another way to get rid of him! (he chuckles and motions to the hunting rifle displayed above the fireplace)

Man 1: Oh come on now, while that would be a blessing to us, that's ridiculous. Just fire the man!

You realize you've paused while looking at a book you've picked up from off the shelf and are staring at the back of the 2 men's heads. You quietly replace the book and dash out of the room without a sound. Do you go to the [[main room]] to tell your date or to the [[bathroom->bathroom]] to privately collect your thoughts and maybe even relieve your bladder?

## Small Office 2 (not detailed)

"Just fire the man!" you overhear as you enter the room, finding two men ending what seems like a jolly discussion.

You stare at the back of the 2 men's heads as they laugh together before deciding to step out into the [[Main room->main room]] to join the rest of the party.


## Coat Room

You enter the room and are impressed by the quality of coats that are hanging about. Real Mink fur, fox, rabbit and others.
Coats that would cost thousands of dollars. A particular coat catches our eye, a pitch black slightly wavy fur, that is somehow
so shiny that it doesn't even seem real. On your way out at the end of the party, you think you will try to remember to see who
has that coat because you want to tell them how beautiful it is.

Your curiosity is peaked and you want to go see what is going on in the [[small office -> small office 2]] but you also want to just go ahead and join the party in the [[main room]]. Where do you go?

## Bathroom

You start trying to find some justification for what you just heard, but just find yourself going in a downwards spiral. You shake your head, and try not to read too much into it anymore. Surely they were joking, right? You notice that you have started sweating and your hands feel clammy. You turn on the sink and wash your face. Maybe some cool water will help you recollect your thoughts. As you close the water, you notice a crimson stain is being washed away. You proceed to wash your hands. The soap has such a pleasant vanilla smell and instantly you feel more at ease. Time to go back to the party. [[main room]]

## Main Room

You enter the ballroom through grande double doors and look around to find your date. Your eyes fall upon a beautiful woman in a slender, red satin gown who is laughing and drinking a glass of champagne with a man. She is wearing a gorgeous string of bright diamonds that are sparkling in the light. You kind of want to go talk to her. You keep searching though and see a man with a distinct Rolex watch talking in hushed tones to someone over by the staircase. Finally you see your date, Taylor, standing over by the food tables.

You are slowly walking forward in the room when the man with the Rolex walks up onto the stairs and clinks a glass to grab everyone's focus:

Rolex man: Good evening everyone, and welcome to my home. I am so glad that you all have gathered here with us tonight and I hope you all have a chance to get to know each other. I am your Host, Buff Wellington, and I can't wait to meet all of you.

He steps down the stairs and you decide where you want to go next:

-Meet the elusive man that is the [[host->host]] of the party

-Talk to your [[date->your date]] and maybe get some food

-talk to that beautiful [[woman->seductress]] with the diamond necklace

# _________________________ Prologue Ends

## Speak To Your Date

You walk up to your date, admiring their classy black outfit that they managed to scrounge together from their closet before the dinner. Neither of you are as rich and well-off as the rest of the party guests, here, but you don't seem to stand out too much. As your date turns around, they have 2 drinks, one in each hand. You grab yours, and they begin to sip on their own drink, a very strong bourbon and coke. You really are hungry so you ask if you can get some food, but your date really wants to start socializing with people. They point you towards the [[host]] of the party and the [[woman]] whose necklace you were admiring earlier. You start to think that you can just grab a quick snack on the way to talk to one of them but you are frightfully starving. Should you tell your date that you would rather just find a waiter with some [[Hors d'eurves->Hors d'eurves]] to hang out by?

But wait, there is a delectable smell coming from the [[kitchen]], maybe you could hide in there and stuff your face for 5 minutes then go socialize.

What do you do?

## Speak to Seductress

"I'm going to go talk to that woman over there. she looks like she knows a lot of the people here, so maybe she can tell us a little about what this party is!", you say to Taylor before you walk over to the Redheaded woman.

You walk up to her and her companion, and say hello.

Her: "why hello my young friend! I'm Darlene, how are you this evening?"

You: "good, how are you?"

Darlene: "Delighted to meet your aquaintance, let meintroduce you to my friend here. This is James, he went to school with Mr. Wellington's son, but he is older. He works at the company with several of the other men here. It's really quite stressful, they are all competing right now for a promotion. There's some good guys, that would do well in the position, but certainly not all of them!" She laughs and jokingly motions towards James. "The only way he'll probably get it is if all the other guys just disappear!" Her laugh sings out, blocking out almost all other noise.

James: "Hey, don't spoil my plans! Ha-ha. As if though, that's not my style really"

You: "Well I didn't realize so many people here worked for our host!"

Very loud [[Live music-> Listen to live music]] begins to play and the pair swirls off, her dancing gracefully and him just sort of following and watching, trying not to spill his beer.

## Speak to Host

You approach the host, eager to meet this mysterious man. He turns and sees you, outstretches his hand that isn't holding a glass of whiskey, and smiles.

Taking his hand, you introduce yourself and he begins talking, "Yes, I invited many co-workers here to this party, and some of their friends. However, I don't recognize you, I didn't personally send the invitations but I'm sure you were invited for a reason. Perhaps you will run into someone you know tonight!"

You think abotu what he said. Someone you know may be here? That seems unlikely, but it is a big party, maybe he is right.

You ask him about his watch and he tells you its a one-of-a-kind Rolex, custom made to fit his wrist like a glove. You start to ask what kind of company it is that he runs but very [[loud music->Listen to Live Music]] begins playing and he encourages you to go dance. 

## Hors d'eurves

Your date leads you towards a waiter with food

## Kitchen

You drift into the kitchen as the wondrous smells pull you in. There you see cooks hastily doing their job. There is a vast array of food that is being cooked. Dish after dish is being shoved out into the dining room.

It seems like you won't have any luck getting food here so you move along into the [[dining room -> Dining Room]] to see if someone will serve you a plate.  ~~you smell amazing things from the kitchen~~

## Dining Room

servants are busy in the dining room, hustle & bustle
option to help one

## Help servant

~~people look down on you, but a servant may tell you something about the host.~~

"Excuse me ma'am, do you need any help?"

"Do I need help? What  kind of absurd question is that? Of course, I need help!" The woman directs you to complete some tasks and you proceed to help her. After you have finished, she thanks you.

"Thank you so much for your help sweetie. If you hadn't helped we would've been so far behind schedule and that would've been terrible, you see...*she lowers her voice* the boss has a bit of a...ummm...a bit of a temper. She nudges her head towards a lanky, paled skin boy.  

"Hmmmph...a bit" he snickers. Do you [[approach him -> Host's Son]] or do you scurry on to the [[dining room -> Dining Room]] ? Taylor might be looking for you.

## Host's Son

* Reaffirms help's statement
* Notice that he has a bruise on his arm
