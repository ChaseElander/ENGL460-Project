# This is where we will put the text for each scene under it's title

## Intro to the house

''Welcome to Madhouse Manor''
You have been invited here, to partake of dinner, entertainment, and many festivities that your distinguished host
has provided for you. We hope you have fun and are prepared for everything tonight has to [[offer->activities]].

## activities

Upon entering the house, you and your plus one see 3 rooms to possibly enter first. There is a [[coat room->coat room]] to
the right  where many people are going in and out of, there is a [[small office->small office 1]] where there seems to be a
few people talking in hushed tones with each other. Finally, straight ahead there is the [[main room->main room]] where the
majority of people seem to be congregating. You really want to shed your coat, but you're also curious about what is in the
office. Where do you go?

## Small Office

You enter the office behind the 2 men who are sitting facing the fire place having a quiet conversation. They don't notice you enter the room alone and continue the conversation:

Man 1: I don't know Roger, the guy just seems so unstable. There's no way he will do well in the company. (He jiggles his wrist to fix the position of his expensive looking Rolex watch)

Man2: But his family is too important to the state, if we get rid of him, our stocks could plummet. His family practically controls the market.

Man 1: Yeah, but if we find just cause, then who are they to do anything? They know what kind of man he is, and he certainly isn't worth those stupid Louis Vuitton shoes he wears.

Man 2: Maybe there is another way to get rid of him! (he chuckles and motions to the hunting rifle displayed above the fireplace)

Man 1: Oh come on now, while that would be a blessing to us, that's ridiculous. Just fire the man!

You realize you've paused while looking at a book you've picked up from off the shelf and are staring at the back of the 2 men's heads. You quietly replace the book and dash out of the room without a sound. Do you go to the [[main room]] to tell your date or to the [[bathroom->bathroom]] to privately collect your thoughts and maybe even relieve your bladder?

## Small Office 2 (not detailed)

"Just fire the man!" you overhear as you enter the room, finding two men ending what seems like a jolly discussion.

You stare at the back of the 2 men's heads as they laugh together before deciding to step out into the [[Main room->main room]] to join the rest of the party.


## Coat Room

You enter the room and are impressed by the quality of coats that are hanging about. Real Mink fur, fox, rabbit and others.
Coats that would cost thousands of dollars. A particular coat catches our eye, a pitch black slightly wavy fur, that is somehow
so shiny that it doesn't even seem real. On your way out at the end of the party, you think you will try to remember to see who
has that coat because you want to tell them how beautiful it is.

Your curiosity is peaked and you want to go see what is going on in the [[small office -> small office 2]] but you also want to just go ahead and join the party in the [[main room]]. Where do you go?

## Bathroom

You start trying to find some justification for what you just heard, but just find yourself going in a downwards spiral. You shake your head, and try not to read too much into it anymore. Surely they were joking, right? You notice that you have started sweating and your hands feel clammy. You turn on the sink and wash your face. Maybe some cool water will help you recollect your thoughts. As you close the water, you notice a crimson stain is being washed away. You proceed to wash your hands. The soap has such a pleasant vanilla smell and instantly you feel more at ease. Time to go back to the party. [[main room]]

## Main Room

You enter the ballroom through grande double doors and look around to find your date. Your eyes fall upon a beautiful woman in a slender, red satin gown who is laughing and drinking a glass of champagne with a man. She is wearing a gorgeous string of bright diamonds that are sparkling in the light. You kind of want to go talk to her. You keep searching though and see a man with a distinct Rolex watch talking in hushed tones to someone over by the staircase. Finally you see your date, Taylor, standing over by the food tables.

You are slowly walking forward in the room when the man with the Rolex walks up onto the stairs and clinks a glass to grab everyone's focus:

Rolex man: Good evening everyone, and welcome to my home. I am so glad that you all have gathered here with us tonight and I hope you all have a chance to get to know each other. I am your Host, Buff Wellington, and I can't wait to meet all of you.

He steps down the stairs and you decide where you want to go next:

-Meet the elusive man that is the [[host->host]] of the party

-Talk to your [[date->your date]] and maybe get some food

-talk to that beautiful [[woman->seductress]] with the diamond necklace

# _________________________ Prologue Ends

## Speak To Your Date

You walk up to your date, admiring their classy black outfit that they managed to scrounge together from their closet before the dinner. As your date turns around, they have 2 drinks, one in each hand. You grab yours, and they begin to sip on their own drink, a very strong bourbon and coke. You really are hungry so you ask if you can get some food, but your date really wants to start socializing with people. They point you towards the [[host]] of the party and the [[woman]] whose necklace you were admiring earlier. You start to think that you can just grab a quick snack on the way to talk to one of them but you are frightfully starving. Should you tell your date that you would rather just find a waiter with some [[Hors d'eurves->Hors d'eurves]] to hang out by?

But wait, there is a delectable smell coming from the [[kitchen]], maybe you could hide in there and stuff your face for 5 minutes then go socialize.

What do you do?

## Speak to Seductress

"I'm going to go talk to that woman over there. she looks like she knows a lot of the people here, so maybe she can tell us a little about what this party is!", you say to Taylor before you walk over to the Redheaded woman.

You walk up to her and her companion, and say hello.

Her: "why hello my young friend! I'm Darlene, how are you this evening?"

You: "good, how are you?"

Darlene: "Delighted to meet your acquaintance, let me introduce you to my friend here. This is James, he went to school with Mr. Wellington's son, but he is older. He works at the company with several of the other men here. It's really quite stressful, they are all competing right now for a promotion. There's some good guys, that would do well in the position, but certainly not all of them!" She laughs and jokingly motions towards James. "The only way he'll probably get it is if all the other guys just disappear!" Her laugh sings out, blocking out almost all other noise.

James: "Hey, don't spoil my plans! Ha-ha. As if though, that's not my style really"

You: "Well I didn't realize so many people here worked for our host!"

Very loud [[Live music-> Listen to live music]] begins to play and the pair swirls off, her dancing gracefully and him just sort of following and watching, trying not to spill his beer.

## Speak to Host

You approach the host, eager to meet this mysterious man. He turns and sees you, outstretches his hand that isn't holding a glass of whiskey, and smiles.

Taking his hand, you introduce yourself and he begins talking, "Yes, I invited many co-workers here to this party, and some of their friends. However, I don't recognize you, I didn't personally send the invitations but I'm sure you were invited for a reason. Perhaps you will run into someone you know tonight!"

You think about what he said. Someone you know may be here? That seems unlikely, but it is a big party, maybe he is right.

You ask him about his watch and he tells you its a one-of-a-kind Rolex, custom made to fit his wrist like a glove. You start to ask what kind of company it is that he runs but very [[loud music->Listen to Live Music]] begins playing and he encourages you to go dance.

## Hors d'eurves

Taylor leads you towards a waiter with some food on a tray that looks absolutely delicious! You grab a solid handful of he snacks and make small talk with the waiter while you try to gracefully shove the food in your mouth.

you: so how do you like working here?

Him: oh, it's wonderful. Mr. Wellington is a great boss.

you: really? Well I guess that makes sense since he runs a company on his own anyway.

Him: yes, well his management of the company is somewhat unorthodox from what I hear.

You take in this information, nod, still chewing your food, then walk away to the [dining room->dining room].

## Kitchen

You drift into the kitchen as the wondrous smells pull you in. There you see cooks hastily doing their job. There is a vast array of food that is being cooked. Dish after dish is being shoved out into the dining room.

It seems like you won't have any luck getting food here so you start to move along into the [[dining room -> Dining Room]] to see if someone will serve you a plate. But you notice a waitress sruggling to load food onto her tray. Do you stop to [help->Help Servant] her?

## Dining Room

You return to the dining room, find Taylor, and take your drink from his hand. Just as you begin to get into conversation, a bell rings and some unseen voice announces that dinner is about to be served and for everyone to take their seats at the [table->Call to Dinner 2].

## Help servant

"Excuse me ma'am, do you need any help?"

"Do I need help? What  kind of absurd question is that? Of course, I need help!" The woman directs you to complete some tasks and you proceed to help her. After you have finished, she thanks you.

"Thank you so much for your help sweetie. If you hadn't helped we would've been so far behind schedule and that would've been terrible, you see...*she lowers her voice* the boss has a bit of a...ummm...a bit of a temper. She nudges her head towards a lanky, pale skinned boy.  

"Hmmmph...a bit" he snickers. Do you [[approach him -> Host's Son]] or do you scurry on to the [[dining room -> Dining Room]] ? Taylor might be looking for you.

## Host's Son

you: "So the guy has a temper huh?"

him: "My dad? Of course he does, he has nothing else to do with his time, so he finds ways to entertain himself when things aren't going absloutely perfectly."

You notice a bruise on the son's arm and think about how big Wellington's temper must really be. Poor kid. You decide not to bother him anymore and move on to the [Dining room]. 

## Listen to Live Music

You aren't much of a dancer, or rather just don't want to embarass yourself in front of all of these people so you hang to the side with Taylor and just enjoy the music, engaging in small talk. A song ends and while you expect another song to begin, the lead singer says that it is time for dinner and everyone needs to take their [seats->Call To dinner] at the table in the dining room. 

# _________________________ Act 2 Begins

# Left side of twine

## Call to Dinner (from other room)

You and Taylor maneuver around the obscenely long dining table and find two place cards with your names on them. In the hustle and bustle of this, you can't tell where everyone is and who is still in the other room. Suddenly there is a loud noise somewhere outside the dining room and most people stop moving. 

What was that?

Do you go [investigate-> Loud Noise Heard] or do you hang out in the dining room to [see what others do-> Party Splits Into 3 Parts]

## Loud Noise Heard

You walk out of the dining room and look around to decide which way to go. You walk into the [hallway-> 2 Hallway].

## Party splits in 3 parts

Everyone looks aroud at each other. No one can decide where the noise came from and whether it is important. Some people just want to stay and eat, some want to go out on the [balcony->2 Balcony], some to the [West side->2 Bedroom] of the house, and others to the [South->2 Ballroom]. Where do you go?

## 2 Balcony

You leave the dining room and go looking for the noise, and end up on a balcony outside a small bedroom. There's a broken wine glass on the ground, most of its contents spilled everywhere. The railing is broken and leaning out over the lawn. *what the hell happened?* you think.

Do you go investigate the [railing->2 Loose Railing] or do you go back to the bedroom you came out through?

## 2 Bedroom

## 2 Ballroom

## 2 Loose Railing

You walk over to the railing, and peer over. There's something down there... what is it? Is it... a body?  Suddenly a squirrel jumps off the roof and lands right behind you making you jump, lose your footing and then fall over the edge. 

You are killed instantly. 

## 2 Back to Bedroom

You turn around and walk back inside. "Something is going on in this place and I don't like it," you say to yourself.

This is just messed up. You walk throught the room and into the [hallway->2 Hallway].

## 2 bathroom

## 2 Hide under table

## 2 Hallway

You walk down the hallway peaking into the different rooms that you see. This is such a big house. You see a large door ajar at the end of the hallway, perhaps it is the [Master Bedroom->2 Master Bedroom] but to your left is a room with a [grand piano->2 Piano Lounge] and sheet music spread on the floor.

Which room do you go to?

## 2 loud crash

## 2 Piano Lounge

You see sheet music spread all over the floor of the room. The piano bench is kicked over. A lamp is knocked on the ground. 

What the hell happened in here?

Wait... you hear heavy breathing... someone is in here.... [CRASH!!!->2 Shattering]


## 2 master bedroom

## 2 shattering

You think someone fell through the window! 

*Holy crap what is wrong with this party* you think to yourself

Do you [hide->2 Shattering Hide] somewhere or do you go [look->2 Shattering Lawn] out the window?

## 2 shattering hide

You look around for a place to hide. Behind the couch? no. Your heat pounds inside you chest, your ears are ringing, your eyes beginning to blur. Do you scurry and dive under the [piano->2 Piano hide], brushing some sheet music underneath with you or do you [hide in the closet->2 Locked in Closet] that is over on the other side of the room?

## 2 shattering lawn

You run across the room and around the corner to where the window is. You don't see anybody except a still lifeless body on the ground. Fear grips your soul, you try to scream but feel like nothing is coming out of your throat. You don't know what to do so you stand motionless, frozen in fear until you hear someone [calling->2 Call Everyone Back Together] for people to come to the dining room. 

## 2 piano hide

You turn around on your stomach so you can see out into the room from your hiding spot. You look around, then down at the sheet music below you. It's dark but you think you can make out something on one of the papers. It looks like a footprint. Men's shoes size 10 maybe? And the faintest mark of a designer's name in the middle, but you can't read it. 

Whose shoe made this mark? Suddenly something drips on your hand from the edge of the piano, you smell it... it smells like... bourbon? whiskey? Is there even a difference betweent he two? you can't tell. You decide to [wait->Wait] for someone else, maybe even Taylor to come find you.

## 1 Locked in closet

You rush over to the closet door, and close the door behind you when you get inside. 

A shadow crosses in front of the door and stops. You hear a deep sinister laugh and then the click of a lock. You look down, grab the door handle and try to turn it but it doesn't budge. 

You are locked in! You bang on the door but no one hears you, no one ever hears you, no one comes back for you. You die in a few days from starvation.
