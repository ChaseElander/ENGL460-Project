## Intro to the house

''Welcome to Madhouse Manor''
You have been invited here, to partake of dinner, entertainment and many festivities that your distinguished host 
has provided for you, we hope you have fun and are prepared for everything tonight has to [[offer->activities]].

## activities

Upon entering the house, you and your plus one see 3 rooms to possibly enter first. There is a [[coat room->coat room]] to 
the right  where many people are going in and out of, there is a [[small office->small office]] where there seems to be a 
few people talking in hushed tones with each other. Finally, Straight ahead there is the [[main room->main room]] where the 
majority of people seem to be congregating. You really want to shed your coat but you're also curious about what is in the 
office. where do you go?

## Small Office

some sort of clever observation that leads you to the [[main room]] or maybe you could choose between that and the [[bathroom->bathroom]]

## Coat Room

You enter the room and are impressed by the quality of coats that are hanging about. Real Mink fur, fox, rabbit and others.
Coats that would cost thousands of dollars. A particular coat catches our eye, a pitch black slightly wavy fur, that is somehow 
so shiny that it doesn't even seem real. On your way out at the end of the party, ou think you will try to remember to see who 
has that coat because you want to tell them how beautiful it is.

The [[Main room->main room]] noise catches your ear and you float out of the coat room to join the party.

## Bathroom

this would then only lead you to the [[main room]] but the people that chose this path might learn some special clue from the bathroom
that could help them with identifyin the killer
