## Intro to the house

''Welcome to Madhouse Manor''
You have been invited here, to partake of dinner, entertainment, and many festivities that your distinguished host
has provided for you. We hope you have fun and are prepared for everything tonight has to [[offer->activities]].

## activities

Upon entering the house, you and your plus one see 3 rooms to possibly enter first. There is a [[coat room->coat room]] to
the right  where many people are going in and out of, there is a [[small office->small office 1]] where there seems to be a
few people talking in hushed tones with each other. Finally, straight ahead there is the [[main room->main room]] where the
majority of people seem to be congregating. You really want to shed your coat, but you're also curious about what is in the
office. Where do you go?

## Small Office

You enter the office behind the 2 men who are sitting facing the fire place having a quiet conversation. They don't notice you enter the room alone and continue the conversation:

Man 1: I don't know Roger, the guy just seems so unstable. There's no way he will do well in the company. (He jiggles his wrist to fix the position of his expensive looking Rolex watch)

Man2: But his family is too important to the state, if we get rid of him, our stocks could plummet. His family practically controls the market.

Man 1: Yeah, but if we find just cause, then who are they to do anything? They know what kind of man he is, and he certainly isn't worth those stupid Louis Vuitton shoes he wears.

Man 2: Maybe there is another way to get rid of him! (he chuckles and motions to the hunting rifle displayed above the fireplace)

Man 1: Oh come on now, while that would be a blessing to us, that's ridiculous. Just fire the man!

You realize you've paused while looking at a book you've picked up from off the shelf and are staring at the back of the 2 men's heads. You quietly replace the book and dash out of the room without a sound. Do you go to the [[main room]] to tell your date or to the [[bathroom->bathroom]] to privately collect your thoughts and maybe even relieve your bladder?

## Small Office 2 (not detailed)

"Just fire the man!" you overhear as you enter the room, finding two men ending what seems like a jolly discussion. 

You stare at the back of the 2 men's heads as they laugh together before deciding to step out into the [[Main room->main room]] to join the rest of the party. 


## Coat Room

You enter the room and are impressed by the quality of coats that are hanging about. Real Mink fur, fox, rabbit and others.
Coats that would cost thousands of dollars. A particular coat catches our eye, a pitch black slightly wavy fur, that is somehow
so shiny that it doesn't even seem real. On your way out at the end of the party, you think you will try to remember to see who
has that coat because you want to tell them how beautiful it is.

Your curiosity is peaked and you want to go see what is going on in the [[small office -> small office 2]] but you also want to just go ahead and join the party in the [[main room]]. Where do you go?

## Bathroom

You start trying to find some justification for what you just heard, but just find yourself going in a downwards spiral. You shake your head, and try not to read too much into it anymore. Surely they were joking, right? You notice that you have started sweating and your hands feel clammy. You turn on the sink and wash your face. Maybe some cool water will help you recollect your thoughts. As you close the water, you notice a crimson stain is being washed away. You proceed to wash your hands. The soap has such a pleasant vanilla smell and instantly you feel more at ease. Time to go back to the party. [[main room]]

## Main Room

You enter the ballroom through grande double doors and look around to find your date. Your eyes fall upon a beautiful woman in a slender, red satin gown who is laughing and drinking a glass of champagne with a man. She is wearing a gorgeous string of bright diamonds that are sparkling in the light. You kind of want to go talk to her. You keep searching though and see a man with a distinct Rolex watch talking in hushed tones to someone over by the staircase. Finally you see your daate, Taylor, standing over by the food tables.

You are slowly walking forward in the room when the man witht he Rolex walks up onto the stairs and clinks a glass to grab everyone's focus:

Rolex man: Good evening everyone, and welcome to my home. I am so glad that you all have gathered here with us tonight and I hope you all have a chance to get to know each other. i am your Host, Buff Wellington, and I can't wait to meet all of you. 

He steps down the stairs and you decide where you want to go next:

-Meet the elusive man that is the [[host->host]] of the party
-Talk to your [[date->your date]] and maybe get some food
-talk to that beautiful [[woman->seductress]] with the diamond necklace
